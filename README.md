## Project Overview
This project involves creating a responsive and accessible webpage from scratch using HTML and CSS. The design is inspired by Nicolas Philippot, a UI/UX designer. The goal is to implement the design without using external CSS libraries or JavaScript.

The webpage is divided into sections:
- Header
- "What we do..." section
- "Our results" section
- Contact form
- Footer

The final design ensures responsiveness on desktop and mobile devices, switching to a mobile version at a screen width of 480px or less.
